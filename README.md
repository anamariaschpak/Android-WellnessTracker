Mobile Devices and Application university subject final-term project

Individual final-term project done following strict requirements from my professor.

The application offers a solution for tracking the user's weight,
computes the BMI giving the user an approximative diagnostic based on statistical parameters found on the Internet 
and provides a calendar in which the user may add notes with their workouts. It also provides an activity where the user can input a meal and find out the ratio of kcal per 100g of food.
